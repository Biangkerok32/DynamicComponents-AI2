# âš¡ Template Creator <small>for Dynamic Components AI2</small>
This sub-project allows you to create templates from App Inventor Project files automatically! So you don't need to write templates manually anymore!

It includes two scripts. `TemplateCreate.py` does the main job which is generating the template, and `cli.py` is made for you to access the `TemplateCreate.py` easily.

> This script requires Python that needs to be installed, but if you have a solution that will work on everyone's computer without installing something, you can always create a Pull Request and a new tool for that :)

To get started, let's make sure everything is ready!

## ðŸš§ Requirements
* **Python 3.x**<br>
Select "Add to the PATH" option during setup.

Then install the external modules by executing `pip install -r requirements.txt` in this directory.

## ðŸ“¦ Usage

* Insert your .aia file in this directory. And remember its name for later step.

* Let's suppose your .aia file name is "HelloWorld.aia", then execute this command:<br>
`python cli.py "HelloWorld.aia"`

You can also type the screen name that you want to get template of it.<br>
`python cli.py "HelloWorld.aia" --screen=Screen1`

If everything goes well, you will see the generated JSON file in this directory.

If you encounter any issues with script, just create a new issue.
